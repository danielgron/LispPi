"# LispPi" 

Fun assignment.
Especially the twist in the slides, where you put in (an+1 + bn+1) instead of (an+1 + bn+1)^2 so pi will tend towards 1.85ish.

At least it's nice for once to be right, when insisting that it must be the assignment that is wrong.
The long-float /roundoff doesn't seem to work. Keeps giving me fractions and floating point overflow,
so you will have to settle for a fraction that gives ~15 decimal points if put in a calculator.
